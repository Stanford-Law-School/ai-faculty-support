          <h2>What it does</h2>
          <p>It reads an opinion as a legal act, not just a story: posture, the question presented, material facts, holding versus dicta, the reasoning and standard of review, remedies, concurrences and dissents, and how later courts have treated it &mdash; grounded in the opinion itself, not the headnotes.</p>

          <h2>Faculty control &amp; integrity</h2>
          <p>You keep authorship and final judgment; treat every output as a draft for expert review. These Skills support faculty research and teaching only &mdash; never client, clinic, or active-matter work &mdash; never fabricate authority, and never state current law without authoritative, current verification.</p>
