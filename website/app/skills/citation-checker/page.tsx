          <h2>What it does</h2>
          <p>It helps you check that a source exists and resolves, that quotations and pinpoints are accurate, that the authority actually supports the stated proposition, that the law has been updated, and that attribution is complete &mdash; using SLS databases and citators, and flagging unsupported claims rather than inventing corrections.</p>

          <h2>Faculty control &amp; integrity</h2>
          <p>You keep authorship and final judgment; treat every output as a draft for expert review. The Skill never treats AI output as evidence, never fabricates sources, authorities, quotations, or findings, never claims institutional approval, and won&rsquo;t take external actions or submit anything without your explicit authorization.</p>
