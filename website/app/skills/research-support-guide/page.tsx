          <h2>What it does</h2>
          <p>It asks what you&rsquo;re actually trying to do right now &mdash; scope an idea, review the literature, plan legal research, build an argument, revise a draft, check citations, edit prose, plan publication, or adapt work for the public &mdash; and points you to the one helper that fits, recommending the smallest useful next step without scoring or ranking you.</p>

          <h2>Faculty control &amp; integrity</h2>
          <p>You keep authorship and final judgment; treat every output as a draft for expert review. The Skill never treats AI output as evidence, never fabricates sources, authorities, quotations, or findings, never claims institutional approval, and won&rsquo;t take external actions or submit anything without your explicit authorization.</p>
